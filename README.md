A high-level API for programmatically interacting with web pages through WebDriver.

This crate uses the [WebDriver protocol] to drive a conforming (potentially headless) browser
through relatively high-level operations such as "click this element", "submit this form", etc.

Most interactions are driven by using [CSS selectors]. With most WebDriver-compatible browser
being fairly recent, the more expressive levels of the CSS standard are also supported, giving
fairly [powerful] [operators].

Forms are managed by first calling `Client::form`, and then using the methods on `Form` to
manipulate the form's fields and eventually submitting it.

For low-level access to the page, `Client::source` can be used to fetch the full page HTML
source code, and `Client::raw_client_for` to build a raw HTTP request for a particular URL.

## Examples

These examples all assume that you have a [WebDriver compatible] process running on port 4444.
A quick way to get one is to run [`geckodriver`] at the command line.

Let's start out clicking around on Wikipedia:

```rust
use fantoccini::{ClientBuilder, Locator};

// let's set up the sequence of steps we want the browser to take
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), fantoccini::error::CmdError> {
    let c = ClientBuilder::native().connect("http://localhost:4444").await.expect("failed to connect to WebDriver");

    // first, go to the Wikipedia page for Foobar
    c.goto("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar").await?;
    let url = c.current_url().await?;
    assert_eq!(url.as_ref(), "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar");

    // click "Foo (disambiguation)"
    c.find(Locator::Css(".mw-disambig")).await?.click().await?;

    // click "Foo Lake"
    c.find(Locator::LinkText("Foo Lake")).await?.click().await?;

    let url = c.current_url().await?;
    assert_eq!(url.as_ref(), "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Lake");

    c.close().await
}
```

How did we get to the Foobar page in the first place? We did a search!
Let's make the program do that for us instead:

```rust
// -- snip wrapper code --
// go to the Wikipedia frontpage this time
c.goto("https://www.wikipedia.org/").await?;
// find the search form, fill it out, and submit it
let f = c.form(Locator::Css("#search-form")).await?;
f.set_by_name("search", "foobar").await?
 .submit().await?;

// we should now have ended up in the right place
let url = c.current_url().await?;
assert_eq!(url.as_ref(), "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar");

// -- snip wrapper code --
```

What if we want to download a raw file? Fantoccini has you covered:

```rust
// -- snip wrapper code --
// go back to the frontpage
c.goto("https://www.wikipedia.org/").await?;
// find the source for the Wikipedia globe
let img = c.find(Locator::Css("img.central-featured-logo")).await?;
let src = img.attr("src").await?.expect("image should have a src");
// now build a raw HTTP client request (which also has all current cookies)
let raw = img.client().raw_client_for(fantoccini::Method::GET, &src).await?;

// we then read out the image bytes
use futures_util::TryStreamExt;
let pixels = raw
    .into_body()
    .try_fold(Vec::new(), |mut data, chunk| async move {
        data.extend_from_slice(&chunk);
        Ok(data)
    })
    .await
    .map_err(fantoccini::error::CmdError::from)?;
// and voilÃ , we now have the bytes for the Wikipedia logo!
assert!(pixels.len() > 0);
println!("Wikipedia logo is {}b", pixels.len());

// -- snip wrapper code --
```

## How to run tests

The tests assume that you have [`chromedriver`] and [`geckodriver`] already running on your system.
You can download them using the links above. Then run them from separate tabs in your terminal.
They will stay running until terminated with Ctrl+C or until the terminal session is closed.

Then run `cargo test` from this project directory.
